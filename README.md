# Language Modeling Predictor (Unigram/Bigram/Uniform)

## Overview
Built unigram, bigram, and uniform language models to analyze folklore corpora based on the works of authors, Andersen and the Grimm Brothers.
Compared vocabulary usage and generated sample text using probability distributions.

## Project Details
- Cleans + tokenizes text corpora
- Computes unigram and bigram probabilities
- Finds high-frequency words and compares corpora
- Generates new text samples from learned distributions
- Visualizes vocabulary patterns
  
📊 Figures and tables are available in the `figures/` directory.
